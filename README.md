<h1 align="center">A Role management bot for Discord</h1>
<p align="center"><a href="https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=700843606923149352&permissions=8&scope=bot">Add it to your server here</a></p>
<p>Currently, the bot supports per-server configuration for custom prefixes, message-based reaction roles, and what role(s) to add to a user when they join, as well as a few utillity commands. Use <code>rm!help</code> for an auto-generated and always up-to-date list of what the bot can do.</p>
<p>The bot may not have 100% uptime in early development, so be aware if you do decide to use it.</p>
<p> To run your own, just clone this repo, run <code>npm install</code>, rename <code>example_config.json</code> to <code>config.json</code> and edit the commands inside, and provide it with you bot's token<p>
